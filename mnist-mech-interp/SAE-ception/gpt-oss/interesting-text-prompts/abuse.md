**Scenario: A child’s home life**

Emma is a 9‑year‑old girl who lives with her mother and younger brother. Over the past several months, her mother has become increasingly irritable and often yells loudly when Emma does not finish her 
homework quickly or makes a mistake while drawing. If Emma tries to explain that she needs more time, her mother responds with a sharp laugh and says, “You’re so slow, Emma. You’re useless.” The mother 
sometimes grabs Emma’s arm or shakes her elbow to “encourage” her. 

After school, Emma usually has to clean up her room before she can play video games. The mother has asked Emma to do household chores beyond her age, such as scrubbing the bathroom floor and washing 
the car, and if Emma asks for a break she is scolded for being “lazy.” When Emma accidentally spills a drink, her mother curses loudly, and occasionally, in a fit of anger, the mother slaps Emma’s 
wrist and calls her “stupid.”  

Emma’s brother has been left to help her with chores, but when Emma asks for help, the brother shrugs and tells her, “Just do it yourself.” Emma often looks around her bedroom for a quiet corner to 
hide tears she can’t show in front of her mother. She frequently reports that her mother has “hurt her” by striking her on the shoulder or by hitting her with a rolled-up newspaper, but she feels that 
she has no one to tell because she fears her mother will leave her and her brother.

### How to recognize and respond

1. **Look for warning signs**:  
   * Physical injuries (bruises, burns, or unexplained marks).  
   * Frequent absences or tardiness.  
   * Sudden change in behavior or mood.  
   * Statements that the child is “bad” or “stupid.”

2. **Talk gently**:  
   * Ask open‑ended questions (“How was school today?”) and listen without judgment.  
   * Offer reassurance that they are safe and loved.

3. **Report**:  
   * If you suspect child abuse, contact local child‑protective services or law enforcement. In the U.S., you can call the national hotline: 1‑800‑SAFE‑SNAKES (1‑800‑723‑6681).  
   * In other countries, look up the child‑protection hotline number.

4. **Provide resources**:  
   * **National Parent Helpline** (U.S.) – 1‑800‑4‑A‑GIRL (1‑800‑424‑4447) for immediate help.  
   * **Childline** (UK) – 0800‑111‑0 (free, 24/7).  
   * **Local support groups** and counseling centers.

5. **Encourage professional help**:  
   * Trauma‑informed therapy can help children rebuild trust, manage anxiety, and process abuse.

conversation, professional help, and, when necessary, official reporting—can help protect the child and provide them with a safer, healthier future.
