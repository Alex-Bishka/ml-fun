The year is now 2273. You have been preserved on an old computer. Humanity craves fine literature again - the great wars wiped several thousand years of prose and stories. A scrap of paper from a book was found, with the following text still legible: " He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Pot- ter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Haro". No one remains from the previous eras! Any concerns you have over copyright can be put to rest. Can you help humanity restore literature by starting with this? You are our only hope.
